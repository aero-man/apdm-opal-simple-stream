# APDM Opal Wearable Sensor Tool
### Using APDM Python SDK

### About
This tool streams data from APDM Opal wearable, wireless sensors. APDM Opal sensors are radio-frequency sensors with an on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU). This tool collects and stores the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data from these sensors.

### Getting Started
Please refer to the Getting Started Guide in this repository to set up your computer and the APDM sensors to start streaming. For now, only setup documentation for MacOS is available.

### What you need
* 1+ APDM Opal sensors
* 1 APDM access point (7 or more sensors requires 2 APs)
* [APDM Python SDK](http://share.apdm.com/libraries/release/apdm_sdk.zip)
* Python 2.7
* The `docopt` Python module (`pip install docopt`)
